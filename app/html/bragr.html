            <h3>BragR.</h3>
            <p>
                BragR is a website where you can post an accomplishment or something that you have done in text, video or photo form and others can either vote that they
                like it or if they don't like it. The idea behind BragR is that people enjoy showing off things that they have done or brought. With the decline of user
                created content on facebook, we wanted a website which is purely user based content. Whenever you create a post you gain reputation, if someone likes your
                content you gain more reputation and if someone doesn't like your content you lose reputation. You can then use your reputation to increase your posts ranking
                so that it will appear higher on the main page.
            <br><br>
                The technologies that I used was Angular.js, Angular Material and Firebase. Angular Material is a set of web components that is based on Google Material Design
                specifications. It is built on top of Angular.js and provides a good relationship between the view and the controller. I had been using Angular.js for a while
                now and was able to use some advanced features of it such as services. Firebase is a very cool piece of technology that I was keen to have a go at. It utilizes
                the nosql JSON data structure. It allows automatic updates across every device and by using Angular.js we were able to do 3 way data binding which allows instant
                updates on the screen whenever the data changes in the database. It also features OAuth, for easy login management and only requires 1 line of code to get it up
                and running.
