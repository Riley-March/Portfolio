            <h3>Snipe Club</h3>
            <p>
                Snipe club was our attempt to join the Agar.io craze. We were sitting at university one day, playing the stupid game when we read about how only 1 person made it.
                So we were like why don't we just make our own game but better. How hard could it be to make a multiplayer game? If only we knew then what we were getting
                ourselves into. The game we set out to make was a free-for-all shooter, where you walk around a massive rectangular playing field and kill other people for
                points. You would only have one type of gun, a sniper rifle which has a slow reload time. So it would rely heavily on skill to aim up the perfect shot. There
                would be destroyable walls that you can hide behind and the game would be endless. After what seemed like endless amounts of pivoting the idea that we ended up
                with was a game where you collect pellets and try to run into other players. The gameplay is not entirely finished seeing as one of the creators left to make his
                own multiplayer game, so the demo is the last iteration before his departure.
            <br><br>
            For the server we used Node.js and Socket.io. Socket.io is a libary that makes using web sockets alot easier. The documentation is excellent and we managed to have
                a simple chat working with a few lines of code. One of biggest challenges was server side prediction and it still haunts me to this day. For the main game we used
                the default html5 canvas. This allowed for lightweight basic graphics and it was easy to control via with client side javascript. The color scheme that we tried
                to go for was a 80â€™s retro look. The deep purples and pinks really gave it a cool, different vibe. We also wanted to add in some really awesome pop synth music
                for it. It's a shame it never turned into anything big and it kinda looks like a clone of slither.io, but it was still a good project to work on.
