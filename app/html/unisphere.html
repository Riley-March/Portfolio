            <h3>Unisphere</h3>
            <p>
                Unisphere is a social media app that allows people within a certain group to interact with each other. Our initial group we were targeting this at was university
                students. We wanted to make it easier to be able to meet new people at university and create a richer social experience. The way it works is that you sign up
                with your university email and it automatically assigns you to a group based on the @ tag at the end of your email. E.G @jcu.edu.au. So this means that it isnt
                restricted just to university students, businesses and companies that have their own email can alse use unisphere. By doing so it puts everyone in the same group
                and you can view everyones posts, profiles and events. Its a mix of twitter where everything is open for people to see but is closed like facebook where only
                people in the group can see the content.
            <br><br>
            Two of my fellow university classmates worked on this project. Sidney De Vries worked on the android app, Aiden De Loryn worked on the iPhone app and I worked on
                the web app. The technologies that I used was a full MEAN stack. Although we didnt decide to use mongoDB due to cross platform database and already have prior
                knowledge with SQL, so that we could have a central database that all 3 platforms hook into. A Node.js server for the backend of the web app, angular.js for
                controlling the front end and I used bootstrap for the main styling of the website. Having only used node.js a few times in the past and only watching a few
                videos on youtube about why angular.js redefines web apps I was keen to finally do a big project with it. It took us about 2 months to fully complete the site
                and have all 3 platforms up and running. Although the site never fully took off with daily users it was still a fun project to work on and I learned alot more
                about angular.js which helped me with future projects. The web app might be seeing a upgrade in the near future upgrading it to use the new angular.js 2, google
                polymer libaries and service workers to turn it into a progressive web app so it will be compatible with the modern web.
